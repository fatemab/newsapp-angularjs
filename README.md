Sample news application implemented using AngularJS

Hi, This is my AngularJs implementation of my 'News App' series in different javascript frameworks.

The workflow of the app is as described below:
  - After splash screen there are two intro pages which are navigated using swipes. Once skipped or read, "Choose Newspaper" screen appears. Intro pages are only one time visited. next time you open app it will not be seen.
  - Select a newspaper name to see the news of the corresponding news media  
  - Click on any one news to get its detail.
  - Navigation drawer can be navigation through menu bar icon or swipes on screen
  - About page is included for app information.
